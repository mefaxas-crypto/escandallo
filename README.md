# Escandallo Frontend

This repository hosts a Vite-powered React frontend for the Escandallo application. It replaces the previous static page with a modular app that integrates with Firebase for authentication and Firestore data.

## Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The `preview` script can be used to serve the production build locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run preview
```
